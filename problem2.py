#Problem 2: Interpretation of Confidence Intervals (Weight 1):
## How do you interpret the confidence intervals you reported in Problem 1?
print("95% CI of expected rewards means that: \
if we simulate the games for a lot of times, and get a confidence interval in each time, 95% of these intervals will cover true mean.\n\
95% CI of probability means that: \
if we simulate the games for a lot of times, and get a confidence interval of probability in each time, 95% of  these intervals will cover true probability of loss.")
